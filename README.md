# csv-intersection
Print the intersection of two CSV files

A very naive python script that compares every cell of one csv to every cell of another and returns the list of similar cells. More than sufficient for now and donâ€™t need to worry about them changing the order of columns or anything.

Usage: 
```
drew@WINDOWS10:~/csv-intersection$ python3 main.py test_data/CurrentSPACsasofOctober2020.csv  test_data/octoberOCCnewoptionmarketunderlyings.csv
```

Test Usage:
```
pytest
```
